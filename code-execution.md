# Code Execution Vulnerabilities

## Overview

Code execution vulnerabilities occur when a web application allows users to execute operating system commands on the server.
These commands may be Windows or Linux based and can lead to severe security issues.

Such vulnerabilities can be abused to obtain reverse shells or upload files to the server using system commands.
