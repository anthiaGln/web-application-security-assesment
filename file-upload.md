# File Upload Vulnerabilities

## Overview

File upload vulnerabilities occur when a web application does not properly validate files that were uploaded by the users. This can allow malicious files to be uploaded and executed on the server. Such vulnerabilities are considered high risk because they may lead to remote command execution, data exposure or full system compromise.
