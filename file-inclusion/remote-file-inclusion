# Remote File Inclusion (RFI)

## Overview

Remote File Inclusion (RFI) occurs when a web application allows files to be included from external servers. 
This vulnerability is dangerous because it can lead to execution of remote code on the target system.

---

## Validation

Remote File Inclusion was enabled by modifying PHP configuration settings on the target system. 
A PHP file containing operating system command executions was created and stored remotely as a `.txt` file.  
By including this file, through a vulnerable parameter, the code was executed on the target server. 
This resulted in a reverse connection being established, 
demonstrating that remote code execution was possible through file inclusion.
