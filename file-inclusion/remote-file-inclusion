# Remote File Inclusion (RFI)

## Overview

Remote File Inclusion (RFI) occurs when a web application allows files to be included from external servers. 
This vulnerability is dangerous because it can lead to execution of remote code on the target system.

---

## Validation

Remote File Inclusion was enabled by modifying PHP configuration settings on the target system. 
A PHP file containing operating system command executions was created and stored remotely as a `.txt` file.  
By including this file, through a vulnerable parameter, the code was executed on the target server. 
This resulted in a reverse connection being established, 
demonstrating that remote code execution was possible through file inclusion.

---

## Impact

Remote File Inclusion vulnerabilities pose a critical security risk due to their potential impact on the system.

An attacker may be able to:

- Execute code hosted on external servers
- Establish reverse connections to external systems
- Gain full control over the affected application or server

In the lab scenario, remote file inclusion resulted in remote code execution and system compromise highlighting the severity of this vulnerability.

---

## Mitigation

To prevent Remote File Inclusion vulnerabilities, the following security measures are recommended:

- Disable `allow_url_fopen` and `allow_url_include` in PHP configuration.
- Do not allow inclusion of files from external or remote sources.
- Avoid dynamic file inclusion using user-supplied input.
- Use static, hard-coded file inclusion instead of dynamic inclusion.
- Ensure that only local and trusted files can be included by the application.

## Best Practice Summary

The most effective way to prevent Remote File Inclusion vulnerabilities is to disable remote file inclusion functionality and avoid dynamic inclusion mechanisms.  
Using static file inclusion and secure server configuration ensures that external files cannot be executed on the server.
