# Lab Environment Setup
The goal of this setup is to safely study common web application security issues without affecting real systems or networks.
## Environment Components
- **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)**  
  An intentionally vulnerable web application used to practice and understand common web application vulnerabilities.

- **Metasploitable**  
  A deliberately vulnerable virtual machine used as the hosting platform for DVWA.

- **Local Virtual Lab : Kali Linux**  
Kali Linux (formerly known as BackTrack Linux) is an open-source, Debian-based Linux distribution which allows users to perform advanced penetration testing and security auditing.
